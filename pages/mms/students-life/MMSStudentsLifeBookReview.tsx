          Book review activities are invaluable for developing critical thinking and analytical skills. They encourage
          students to engage deeply with business literature, enhancing their understanding of key concepts and
          theories. By articulating their insights and critiques, students improve their communication skills. This
          activity also fosters a habit of continuous learning, essential for future business leaders. Our students at
          the department have successfully reviewed and presented their learning on selected books.
