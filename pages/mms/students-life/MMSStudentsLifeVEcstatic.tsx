          The annual College Fest "V-Ecstatic" is a highly anticipated event, bringing together students, faculty, and
          the community for a celebration of talent, creativity, and camaraderie. This vibrant festival serves as a
          platform for MMS students to showcase their diverse skills and foster a spirit of unity and enthusiasm. The
          Fest provided a holistic experience, blending fun, learning, and social responsibility. It fostered a sense
          of community, allowing students to bond, collaborate, and celebrate their collective achievements. The event
          also offered a break from academic routines, giving students a chance to unwind and rejuvenate.
